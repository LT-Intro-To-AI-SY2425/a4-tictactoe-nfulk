# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe? When I didn't realize why my board wasn't printing which caused me to stay stuck with the first two challenges in the read me for a long time. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.The way I would add a computer player to the game is by teaching the ai to learn the game of tic tac toe and face off against real life players on different skill levels(Beginner, Medium, Hard).

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I honestly really don't know other than training it by playing millions of games to learn how to play the game and how to play it the best.
